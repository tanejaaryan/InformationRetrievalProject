The course will encourage students to think reflexively while designing their research proposals, by asking ways social position of the researcher is connected to data production. Through this, questions of objectivity, interpretation, social construction in the production of ethnographic knowledge will be explored, by bringing questions of power and the politics of representation in the production of social \u2018facts\u2019.

If ethics, under conditions of modernity, is compelled to take a more procedural form, as a reaction to ethical scepticism and the evisceration of \u2018ethical content\u2019 that the deracination of God from nature, hence of purposiveness in nature, entails, then the issue of what remains of the \u2018old\u2019 in the \u2018new\u2019, of the ancient in the modern, also surfaces. These themes would be pursued in different modalities, by raising, for instance, the problematic of the (privileged) ontological status of the \u2018human\u2019 (as opposed to the \u2018animal\u2019), in the modern discourse on \u2018Human rights\u2019.  \n", "lecture topic": ["Introduction: What is Metaethics?

A multi-disciplinary domain, design consists of, aesthetics, architecture, products, communication, processes, systems, technology, business/commerce, ramification on environment and society and demands clear understanding of design fundamentals. Apart from the thorough knowledge of core concepts, design also requires the representation of concepts visually to make effective or functional communication and iteration of ideas. For creative skills and aesthetic sense, one must clearly understand the use of basic design elements and their applications for a particular design solution. \nFor a designer to communicate more concisely and in a visually appropriate manner, it is necessary to use commonly understood principles, perspective and design layout standards. Together, these conventions constitute a visual language, and help to ensure that the drawing is clear and relatively easy to understand. \n\nVISUAL COMMUNICATION\nThe concept and science of Visual Communication is introduced as the relationship between human information processing, with emphasis on processing of visual information and design of messages. It includes visual perception, Gestalt laws of organization, semantics, working memory (STM & LTM) and their implications on.\nThe course also introduces students to the fundamentals of Typography and Photography. The Typography course introduces students to the fundamentals of Typography and its application in effective product interface/communication. And the Photography course introduces the students to photography as a medium of visual language and applies it to visual design. In today\u2019s world that is crowded with visual stimulus it is important to cut through the noise and be able to decipher, capture and create visual images that communicate.\n", "lecture topic": ["1.
