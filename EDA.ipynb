It exposes students to data gathering techniques, designing a research proposal, conducting structured and unstructured interviews, while at the same time introducing key debates on the conditions of producing knowledge. The course will encourage students to think reflexively while designing their research proposals, by asking ways social position of the researcher is connected to data production. Through this, questions of objectivity, interpretation, social construction in the production of ethnographic knowledge will be explored, by bringing questions of power and the politics of representation in the production of social ‘facts’.  At the end of the course, students will be able to be able to design research projects and write grant applications, while being reflexive of the location through which research is produced. ',\n",

Right from the food we eat, the clothes we wear, the cars we drive, the media we consume, the technologies we use and the health and educational services we get, consumption pervades our everyday lives and practices. The course on Consumer Culture and Society will draw students into questions like- is shopping only a frivolous activity? Do people claim identities through commodities? What is modern consumption based on- needs or wants? Emphasis in this course will be on understanding consumption practices by embedding them within their social, cultural, and economic contexts. An introduction to classic anthropological studies on consumption and material exchange will provide insights into material culture that has transitioned into corporate cultures of material exchange. Both the positive and negative impacts of consumerism on individuals and societies will be interrogated. Lectures will be complimented through field-based activities where students will examine consumption places and spaces (shopping malls, local markets, advertisements and e-stores) to understand what all (in addition to the actual product) is being sold – an image, a lifestyle, a status symbol, a body type, modernity etc. Using specific consumption domains like food, fashion, media/entertainment technology and intimate relations the course will make the learners engage with the ideas of liberation, choice, identity, status, inequality, lifestyle, freedom, signification, and power.

But ever wondered that in GoT, land and titles are being passed in the male bloodline while the women are married off for political reasons and alliances? The former are mostly depicted as violent, muscular, powerful and aggressive while the latter as being submissive, dependent, innocent and sexualised. In varying forms and degrees these characterisations are replicated across various media platforms.  Drawing primarily from sociology and supporting literature from media studies, cultural studies, feminist theory, and internet/new media studies, the course on gender and media will introduce students to mediated construction and presentations of gender through engagement with representations of masculinity, femininity and sexualities, and their intersectionality with class, race, ethnicity and caste, in print and electronic media. The course will interrogate the political economy, diversity and\\xa0the composition of labour market of media industry to understand gendered power inequalities in media. Instagram and Facebook content will be examined to probe questions around how media becomes an important means for self-presentation, power, assertion and identity formation. The course will also discuss issues of digital spaces, safety and risk through an engagement with issues of cyber misogyny and gendered online activism by drawing on contemporary examples of hashtag activism namely #metoo, #youtoo, #notallmen and #blacklivesmatter. Grounded in learning by doing, an important part of the course will be to train students to not just become critical consumers but also responsible producers of media. The course will involve assignments and activities on content analysis of television sitcoms, advertisements, Bollywood and regional cinema, print media and digital platforms (blogs, vlogs, avatars) to analyse gendered and racialized language and embodiment in the construction of identities. All the writings that the students do will be used to create a blog on interrogating media from a gender lens. \\n',\n",

Enterprises have gathered this information (based on the view defined) from multiple data sources and stored it in a central repository, called data warehousing, for decision support functionalities and data analysis. This kind of analysis is best-suited when the support for decision making is based on the historical or point-in-time view of the business, not on a (near) real-time view and/or knowledge. Since the “structured” data constitutes only a fraction of the entire information content within an enterprise, which also includes “unstructured” content like reports, email, meeting minutes, web-pages etc, the enterprises are now realizing to integrate their entire information sources across structured and unstructured data sources.  \\n\\nThe objective of this course is to cover the various methods of integrating homogeneous and heterogeneous information (structured/semi-structured (XML) and unstructured) through schema integration (virtual and materialized), entity extraction and matching, etc.  This course will be equally focused on implementation and developing an application to demonstrate the leaned techniques for new ways to integration information.

This shift, broadly characterized, consists in moving from the question of what constitutes a ‘good life’—one that is conducive to the fullest realization of human potentiality, to what constitutes ‘right’ or ‘wrong’ action.  \\n    This course will articulate and analyse the major ethical theories and approaches in the Western tradition in light of this shift. Such a broad historical perspective would allow students to apprehend why for instance, the preoccupation with the ‘Good’ gives rise to ethics of a particular ‘shape’, namely, ‘virtue ethics’; whereas the questions of ‘right’ and ‘wrong’, along with the procedural mode of their determination, emerge in the context of Enlightenment modernity, and the ‘disenchantment of nature’ that it brings in its wake. If ethics, under conditions of modernity, is compelled to take a more procedural form, as a reaction to ethical scepticism and the evisceration of ‘ethical content’ that the deracination of God from nature, hence of purposiveness in nature, entails, then the issue of what remains of the ‘old’ in the ‘new’, of the ancient in the modern, also surfaces. These themes would be pursued in different modalities, by raising, for instance, the problematic of the (privileged) ontological status of the ‘human’ (as opposed to the ‘animal’), in the modern discourse on ‘Human rights’.  \\n',\n",

A multi-disciplinary domain, design consists of, aesthetics, architecture, products, communication, processes, systems, technology, business/commerce, ramification on environment and society and demands clear understanding of design fundamentals. Apart from the thorough knowledge of core concepts, design also requires the representation of concepts visually to make effective or functional communication and iteration of ideas. For creative skills and aesthetic sense, one must clearly understand the use of basic design elements and their applications for a particular design solution. \\nFor a designer to communicate more concisely and in a visually appropriate manner, it is necessary to use commonly understood principles, perspective and design layout standards. Together, these conventions constitute a visual language, and help to ensure that the drawing is clear and relatively easy to understand. \\n\\nVISUAL COMMUNICATION\\nThe concept and science of Visual Communication is introduced as the relationship between human information processing, with emphasis on processing of visual information and design of messages. It includes visual perception, Gestalt laws of organization, semantics, working memory (STM & LTM) and their implications on.\\nThe course also introduces students to the fundamentals of Typography and Photography. The Typography course introduces students to the fundamentals of Typography and its application in effective product interface/communication.
