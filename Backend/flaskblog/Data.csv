Anthropology of Social Media.xlsx,4,SOC205,"When we hear the words 'social media' we immediately think of Facebook and Twitter, WhatsApp and Instagram. But these are just platforms. Actually, Social media is the vast amount of content we have produced and its consequences for our lives. The content we produce are not just memes and selfies alone, but they are also tools for making and breaking relationships, a means for creating equality and/or reinforcing inequality. While there have been grand claims made about how social media has impacted the lives of people around the world, we often fail to ask is it really likely that social media has changed the life of a low-income builder in Brazil in exactly the same way as it has for an IT professional in South India or that of a factory worker in China? Consider this claim... social media is a sort of big brother that knows all our intimate details and we have lost our rights to privacy. While it is true for some, it is equally true that social media is also the first-time people experience privacy. For e.g. In China, for some people far from being a threat to their privacy, social media was actually the very first time they had experienced what we would call individual privacy. This was true in Turkey as well. Similarly, while it is true that while some might view social media as a distraction to education, it is equally true that for a few others social media is itself education. Likewise, for some the Selfie is more about expressing friendship rather than individual glamour, thus subverting the notion of individualism. How do we know this? Why do people see the same phenomenon differently? While it is important to understand ‘what’ content we produce, the question of why we produce such content is equally significant. This course meant as an introductory course is about ‘people’ and an attempt at understanding the affinities, connectedness, and reciprocities that social media builds.

The course also has an applied theme and will conclude with three different applications of concepts: to engineering via optimization on manifolds, to mathematics via de Rham cohomology of manifolds, and to physics via modeling of Maxwell’s equations.
We shall review basic concepts from multivariable calculus, linear algebra, algebra, geometry and topology first as well as intersperse them later as and when needed. Initially, this shall include geometry in linear algebra, partial and directional derivatives, multiple integrals, alternating multilinear algebra, parametric curves and surfaces, and tangent vectors and spaces. Next, we shall introduce differential forms via integration, the exterior derivative, wedge product of forms, and properties of differential forms in R^n. This will be followed by a quick discussion of Riemannian metric, the Hodge star map, and inner product of differential forms in this context. Discussion of Stoke’s theorem, an introduction to smooth manifolds, notion of vector fields, push forward and pullback maps will form the last conceptual module.

Computability Theory.xlsx,4,MTH507,"This course is an introduction to the mathematical theory of computable and non-computable functions. Computability theory (Recursion theory) emerged as a distinct branch of mathematics from the formal studies in the 1930’s by several logicians, including Gödel, Church, and Turing. The importance of this theory is evident from the applications and implications in fields as diverse as computer science, philosophy and the foundations of mathematics, as well as in many other areas of mathematics itself.
We will roughly cover the Chapters 1-5 of the textbook, “Turing Computability” by Robert Soare. The topics covered will be as follows.
Definition of computable functions; the Halting problem and other unsolvable problems; computably
enumerable sets; relative computability and Turing degrees/ degrees of unsolvability; the Turing jump operator; the Arithmetical hierarchy; the classification of computably enumerable sets; simple and hypersimple sets.

Right from the food we eat, the clothes we wear, the cars we drive, the media we consume, the technologies we use and the health and educational services we get, consumption pervades our everyday lives and practices. The course on Consumer Culture and Society will draw students into questions like- is shopping only a frivolous activity? Do people claim identities through commodities? What is modern consumption based on- needs or wants? Emphasis in this course will be on understanding consumption practices by embedding them within their social, cultural, and economic contexts. An introduction to classic anthropological studies on consumption and material exchange will provide insights into material culture that has transitioned into corporate cultures of material exchange. Both the positive and negative impacts of consumerism on individuals and societies will be interrogated. Lectures will be complimented through field-based activities where students will examine consumption places and spaces (shopping malls, local markets, advertisements and e-stores) to understand what all (in addition to the actual product) is being sold – an image, a lifestyle, a status symbol, a body type, modernity etc. Using specific consumption domains like food, fashion, media/entertainment technology and intimate relations the course will make the learners engage with the ideas of liberation, choice, identity, status, inequality, lifestyle, freedom, signification, and power.

Decision procedures have been actively used in numerous applications ranging from program analysis and verification to security and constraint solving. The more popular term that describes this field is Satisfiability Modulo Theories or SMT. The technology due to the recent developments in SAT solvers has attracted researchers as well as practitioners. In this course, we will learn about theories that are expressive enough to model real problems, but are still decidable. Specifically, we will focus on decision procedures for first-order theories that are commonly used in automated verification and reasoning, theorem-proving, compiler optimization and operations research. The techniques are based on foundational topics including logic and are routinely used in industry. Therefore familiarity with first order logic as well as some experience in (preferably) C/C++ or Java programming language is assumed. At the end of the course, students will learn about SAT, CDCL, Satisfiability Modulo theories (SMT), and the DPLL(T) framework. They will study equalities and uninterpreted functions, linear arithmetic, arrays, and pointer logic.

Grounded in learning by doing, an important part of the course will be to train students to not just become critical consumers but also responsible producers of media. The course will involve assignments and activities on content analysis of television sitcoms, advertisements, Bollywood and regional cinema, print media and digital platforms (blogs, vlogs, avatars) to analyse gendered and racialized language and embodiment in the construction of identities. All the writings that the students do will be used to create a blog on interrogating media from a gender lens.

Information Integration and Applications.xlsx,4,CSE656,"Strictly typed data in an enterprise can be meaningfully decomposed at a fine granularity and stored in a relational database. Such data is mostly operational business data (e.g. sales, accounting, payroll, inventory), and has been the mainstay of database systems since their inception. Enterprises have gathered this information (based on the view defined) from multiple data sources and stored it in a central repository, called data warehousing, for decision support functionalities and data analysis. This kind of analysis is best-suited when the support for decision making is based on the historical or point-in-time view of the business, not on a (near) real-time view and/or knowledge. Since the “structured” data constitutes only a fraction of the entire information content within an enterprise, which also includes “unstructured” content like reports, email, meeting minutes, web-pages etc, the enterprises are now realizing to integrate their entire information sources across structured and unstructured data sources.

Introduction to Sociology and Anthropology_SOC101.xlsx,4,SOC101,"Who has the solution to ‘big problems’ like violent crimes, cybersecurity, environmental degradation, HIV or Ebola crisis and population explosion? If you think the answer is only scientists and government you are mistaken. In the contemporary world social scientists are actively engaged in solving many of these issues along with scientists and the divide between social sciences and STEM disciplines is becoming a thing of the past. In United Kingdom for example, the defence ministry uses social scientists as think tanks to understand defence and security challenges. In Africa, the fight against Ebola involved medical sociologists and anthropologists providing data to medical fraternity on community hygiene practices and sanitary behaviours. In India and China, social anthropologists have been critical to formulation of regulations regarding population policies and new reproductive technologies. To benefit more from these exchanges and engagements, it is important for budding engineers to understand what is sociology and social anthropology, what is its subject matter and how can these disciplines be strategically used for finding solutions to larger societal issues. This introductory course is mandated to introduce learners from diverse academic and social backgrounds to the discipline of Sociology and anthropology. It is intended to make learners understand the fundamental relationship between individual, culture and society. The course will help them develop a sociological perspective by focussing on foundational sociological/anthropological concepts such as social structure, organization,  institutions, status and roles, social change and social problems. All these key terms would be examined with reference to modern social theories and methods. These concepts will then be used to analyse observable social phenomenon like class inequality,  discrimination, ethnic an communal conflicts, poverty, health and illness, crime, globalization and consumption among others, to help learners develop a sociological understanding of the world we inhabit.","['Emergence of Sociology: The Great Revolutions', 'Sociology: Common sense or Science?', 'Sociological Imagination: Relationship between Individual and Society', 'Culture, Ethnocentricism, Cultural Relativism, Global Culture', 'Groups, Organization and Rise of Network Society', 'Micro-Sociology: The Social Construction of Everyday Life', 'Self, Social Interaction and Ethnomethodology', 'Socialization and Development', 'Status and Role', 'Deviance and Control', 'Stratification and Inequality ', 'Collective Behaviour and Social Change', 'Summing up and Review']","{'Type of Evaluation': '% Contribution in Grade', 'Quiz': 20, 'Response Papers': 20, 'Project': 20, 'Mid Semester Exam ': 20, 'End Semester Exam': 20, '*Please insert more row for other type of Evaluation': None, 'Resource Material': None, 'Type': 'Title', 'Textbook': 'Tischler, H. 2007.

Key Concepts in Economic Sociology(Updated version).xlsx,4,SOC 212,"Traditional economic analysis takes the rational individual as its starting point. Economic Sociology on the other hand encourages students to see rational self-interest and action as embedded in society, influenced by group dynamics, legal institutions, power, organizations and even culture. It justifies the application of independent sociological methods and concepts to the examination and understanding of the Economy as a sphere of production, consumption and exchange of goods and services, which is observable in all human societies, not only the modern and advanced. It thereby encourages students to relate economic actions to all other forms of social actions observable in society – the religious, the familial, the technological and the political. In sum, Economic sociology identifies the obligatory, symbolic and power seeking motivations underlying human economic action, not only the useful or utilitarian.

The students will learn the concepts behind the techniques, and will apply their learning to develop analyses using the state-of-art tools. Ensuring program correctness can be very challenging.
Programmers depend on testing to build some confidence in the expected behavior of programs. Although testing is essential, the complexity as well as the criticality of modern software demands more rigorous techniques, in addition to testing, to ensure software correctness. The properties that programs need to satisfy vary from safety properties to security properties and in terms of expressiveness from simple predicates that check the program states at specific execution points to regular expressions and context- free grammars that check the legality of traversed program paths. In this course, we will focus on program verification and the  students will learn about static analysis techniques, i.e., the techniques that can be applied to programs without running the programs as well as about dynamic analysis (or runtime monitoring) techniques that analyze programs during runtime. The students will learn about the strengths and weaknesses of both techniques. In the static analysis, we will primarily focus on dataflow analysis, and learn about some standard analyses that are used in program verification and optimization. However, the course will also introduce   students to some advanced static analysis topics such as symbolic execution, and will cover some topics related to security analysis.

Is technology the material artefact? Or the web of social relations in which it is developed, deployed and used? Or is technology the values that drive it, including ideas of growth, development, efficiency, reducing human labour and conquering the natural world. While the course does not focus on a particular technology, because it is exploring more fundamental ideas of technology and its relation to science and society, the tutorials and evaluation will be based on case studies from Biotechnology, Nanotechnology, Robotics, Cognitive Sciences and Artificial Intelligence. In examining case studies of these technologies, the course will introduce students to criteria for understanding and evaluating the above technologies. In doing so, sociological perspectives are brought to the study of science and technology, in order to question the conceptual divide between science as theory, technology as its application and society as unrelated to them. 
The course will study science, technology and society as continuous domains, which will allow students to explore different perspectives on science that question the taken for granted-ness of reality, by paying attention to the social processes of knowledge making. Further the course will encourage students to study the social circumstances of developing the above-mentioned technologies by thinking about the use and effect of technology on society. This will promote critical thinking about technology: how are technologies compatible with particular political systems? What are its effects on existing power structures? How does it relate to systems of governing? And finally how does it impact ecology or raise concerns of sustainability?

The course is structured to systematically build on and provide an overview of several ideas and topics that comprise the basics of discretizations of continuous mathematics. In this setup, we will concern ourselves with computational as well as stability analyses of both methods and algorithms. 

We will begin with an introduction to scientific computing. Then we will analyze and study methods in numerical linear algebra: matrix factorizations, direct solution of linear systems, solutions of linear least square problems, and solutions to eigenvalue problems.

This will be followed by solutions of nonlinear equations in 1d and then more generally. We will apply this learning to unconstrained optimization in 1d and again more generally. We will also delve into some constrained optimization and nonlinear least squares problems.

The next part of the course will discuss polynomial interpolation (including using splines) of discrete data in 1d. This will be utilized in methods for numerical differentiation of sampled data, and for numerically carrying out integration in 1d (also known as quadrature).

The last part of the course will deal with numerical solutions of initial and boundary value ordinary differential equations in 1d. This will be followed by a foray into numerical solution of model partial differential equations.

SKETCHING COMMUNICATION NARRATIVES Course Description_ Nov 2019 .xlsx,4,DES5xx,"Sharing stories has been the most important way of communication since the early ages of mankind. Cave paintings, books, cinema, more recently an array of digital mediums; all of which are examples of narratives help to communicate, emotional connect, empthise, or even understand ideas, concerns and concepts.  According to anthropologist, Mary C. Bateson, ""the human species thinks in metaphors and learns through stories."" Metaphors help human's to understand abstract concepts.

Design can be distinguished by a particular cognitive style. Gedenryd (1998)'s work in cognitive science, makes it clear that sketching is fundamental in design process. Besides the ability to make sketches, a designer's use of them is a distinct skill that develops with practice, and is fundamental to their cognitive style. 

Sketching in design is not limited to using pencil on paper, it is an exercise of imagination and understanding (mental and experiential). Sketching in interaction design is analogous to traditional sketching in design, it needs to capture the essence of design concepts around transitions, dynamics, feel, phrasing, and all other unique attributes of interactive systems. Sketching in interaction design has a variety of attributes which make its purpose more clear, namely, quick, timely, inexpensive, disposable, plentiful, clear vocabulary, minimal detail, suggest and explore rather than conform and ambiguity.","['CLASS 1.

Spatial Statistics and Spatial Econometrics.xlsx,4,ECO324/524,"The purpose of this course is to introduce the standard spatial-analytic framework for analyzing spatial data and its target audience are social scientists and engineers. In the past decade or so, much interest has grown in the area due to readily-available spatially-delineated data, particularly when in 2008 the U.S. Geological Survey stopped charging for its high-resolution LANDSAT archive. However, spatial data and spatial relationships necessitate the use of analytic tools beyond the standard statistical methods such as OLS. The role of spatial autocorrelation (also known as multidimensional autocorrelation) in spatial datasets is a focus of this course. In addition, we will ask: how and why does spatial autocorrelation arise; how is it measured and understood; how does it relate to issues of spatial heterogeneity and spatial dependence; and how these factors inform the specification and estimation of regression models. Specific modeling techniques include spatial autocorrelation measures (Moran's I, Geary's C), spatial regression models.",[],{'Type of Evaluation': '% Contribution in Grade'},5,Econometrics I (ECO321),ECO,,,,,

Visual-Design-and-Communication.xlsx,4,DES2xx,"VISUAL DESIGN 
Based on the premise that Visual Design is a discipline of design that applies the principles of visual language for better analysis and understanding of design problem and solution, this course focuses on the elements and principles of the visual language and their semantic use. A multi-disciplinary domain, design consists of, aesthetics, architecture, products, communication, processes, systems, technology, business/commerce, ramification on environment and society and demands clear understanding of design fundamentals. Apart from the thorough knowledge of core concepts, design also requires the representation of concepts visually to make effective or functional communication and iteration of ideas. For creative skills and aesthetic sense, one must clearly understand the use of basic design elements and their applications for a particular design solution. 
For a designer to communicate more concisely and in a visually appropriate manner, it is necessary to use commonly understood principles, perspective and design layout standards. Together, these conventions constitute a visual language, and help to ensure that the drawing is clear and relatively easy to understand. 

VISUAL COMMUNICATION
The concept and science of Visual Communication is introduced as the relationship between human information processing, with emphasis on processing of visual information and design of messages. It includes visual perception, Gestalt laws of organization, semantics, working memory (STM & LTM) and their implications on.
The course also introduces students to the fundamentals of Typography and Photography. The Typography course introduces students to the fundamentals of Typography and its application in effective product interface/communication. And the Photography course introduces the students to photography as a medium of visual language and applies it to visual design.

"Wearable Applications, Research, Devices, Interactions.xlsx",4,DES513,"This is a course about the current paradigm of Wearable Computing. In this course, we will cover the origins, pioneering contributions, and principles of Wearable Computing. With this foundation, we will initiate our exploration into the space by learning how to design physical (device form factor), digital (applications) as well as human (interaction techniques) aspects of Wearables. You will develop the skills needed to conduct design of these three interrelated elements and also get a chance to apply them on short assignments and student- selected group projects. We will also discuss and critique both seminal and cutting-edge research in the domain to help you identify opportunities for new research that may begin with your class projects.","['Introduction: Basic Concepts; Design Styles; Designing vs. Fabrication; Processes involved in taking an ""Idea"" to RTL: Software/Hardware Partitioning, Behavioral', 'Overview of ""RTL to GDS"" Design, Verification and Test Flow; Processes after GDS Tapeout to Final Chip;', 'Design capture: HDL (Verilog), Library and Constraints;', 'RTL Simulation and Synthesis; Static Timing Analysis; Power Analysis;', 'Introduction to Formal Methods: Equivalence Checking, BDD, SAT;', 'Logic Synthesis: Optimization, Technology Mapping;', 'Design for Test (DFT): Fault Models, Scan Insertion, ATPG, BIST', 'Overview of CMOS Fabrication Technology; Basics of', 'Floorplanning, Power Planning;', 'Placement: Techniques and Optimization;', 'Clock Tree Synthesis: Distribution, Skew Optimization; Routing: Global and Detailed; ECO', 'Physical Verification: Extraction, LVS, ERC, DRC; Sign- off', 'Summing-up and Paper Presentations']","{'Type of Evaluation': '% Contribution in Grade', 'Assignment': 25, 'Paper presentation': 15, 'Mid-sem': 20, 'End-sem': 40, '*Please insert more row for other\ntype of Evaluation': None, 'Resource Material': None, 'There is no prescribed Text Book for this Course.
